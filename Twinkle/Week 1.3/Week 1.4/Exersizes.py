# Problem 1a
# Write a while loop that determines the sigma of a positive number. 
# The sigma of a positive integer is defined as the sum of all positive integers from 1 to n. 
# For example, the sigma of 6 is 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21.


# Problem 1b
# Now write the same program but with a forloop


# Problem 2
'''

 For example number = 2 so the output should be:

 2
 4

 8
 10
 12
