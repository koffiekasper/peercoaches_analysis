#Problem 1 Logical order

# what is the outcome of r, s, t and x?

p = True
q = False

r = p and q or p
s = not r and q
t = p and p or not s and r
x = not t and q


#Problem 2 Using if-elif-else

#Write a program that asks a user to input a number between 1-7
#Then store the input in the variable called 'day'. 
#The day of the week that corresponds to the value stored in the variable should be assigned to a string s. 
#If a value other than 1 – 7 is stored in the variable an error message should be printed.

#For example:
# * if the variable `day` stores the number 1 => output = Sunday
# * if the variable `day` stores the number 2 =>  output = Monday
# * if the variable `day` stores the number 5=> s = output = Thursday
